                About the Legend
            </h1>



            <p>
                <br> ☛ Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is perhaps one of the greatest Qawwali singers to have ever graced the Earth. The legacy he has created has been truly immeasurable...
                <br><br> ☛ Born in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Pakistan in 1948, Khan sahib had an influential musical career which involved different genres. Sadly, he died at the relatively young age of 48, but his music is still alive today.</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ Nusrat’s love for Qawwalis and Sufi music gave him the unique honour of being regarded as a Master Qawwal by anyone who had the pleasure of watching him perform.
                <br><br> ☛ His music is known to have a spiritual significance to it, many people believed that Khan Sahib fell into a state of trance while singing and despite his short-lived career, he became worthy of titles such as Shahenshah-e-Qawwali.
                <br><br> ☛ He was initially trained in the art of Qawwal by his father, Fateh Ali Khan, who was part of a long line of professional Qawwal singers.
                <br><br> ☛ A young Nusrat began learning to play the tabla before eventually moving on to Raag Vidya, Bolbandish, and Khayal – singing in the classical framework.
                <br><br> ☛ His father sadly passed away in 1964 and Nusrat was left to the guidance of Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan and Ustad Salamat Ali Khan who completed his training.
                <br><br> ☛ Khan sahib’s performances were phenomenal. It is no surprise that people who went to his concerts for the first time were mesmerised by the music. He stirred excitement in their hearts. Interestingly, he also always seemed to
                enjoy every single performance.
                <br><br> ☛ It was his impact on an international level that was truly spectacular. Oriental Star Agencies (OSA) owner, Mohammad Ayyub, was responsible for bringing Khan sahib to the UK from Pakistan, to expose his incredible talent.
                <br><br> ☛ Ayyub recalls first listening to a recording of ‘Haq Ali Ali’ in 1977, brought back from Pakistan by a friend. The song completely mesmerised all the listeners.
                <br><br> ☛ Ayyub was confident that Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan would be an immediate success among the South Asian’s in Britain yearning for their homeland. And indeed he was right. Subsequently, Ayyub introduced Khan sahib to remixers like
                Bally Sagoo who produced the hugely selling album Magic Touch.
                <br><br> ☛ Khan sahib felt that younger generations had no idea about Qawwali or Sufi music and therefore, by experimenting and mixing his voice with different Western genres, it would provide the platform to promote the music to younger
                audiences. This certainly worked with him appealing to the masses.
                <br><br> ☛ His live concerts and mehfils across the country were quickly sold out as news of Khan sahib spread. Khan sahib spanned a 25-year career seeing him produce over 120 albums for many record labels including OSA, Real World (owned
                by Peter Gabriel), Navras Records, EMI, Saregama and many more.
                <br><br> ☛ Even people who didn’t understand the language were still able to relate to his music and understand his emotions. It was this ability to form a connection with the audience that rewarded him with such fame.
